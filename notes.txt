`http.get('')` is used to make a request to a url
`sleep(x)` - this is essentially a wait. the virtual user will pause for x seconds before continuing

Run a script in a file:
in mac - k6 run ./first-script.js
on pc - k6 run .\first-script.js

DEFINITIONS
VU = virtual user
latency = time taken to make a request and get a response
throughput = number of requests a server can handle in a given time
request duration = time it took for request to complete
p90 = 90% of requests had a less than or equal latency (or other metric type)
Guaranteeing that p100 is below a certain value is probably unrealistic, and so Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) are often defined such as 99% of responses must be within 2 seconds, 95% of responses must be within 1 second, etc..
Smoke test = checking the basic functionality works using 1 virtual user. these are the best results we'd expect to see. This is NOT a performance test.


Examples
- Setting vus=5 and duration=10s, this would result in each of the 5 users making the request over and over (in a loop) once the previous request is complete. So we have 5 users making requests concurrently during the 10 seconds. This will result in a number of 'iterations' or 'total requests' (lets call it x), based on how many requests could be conducted by each user in that time. This doesn't prove that you can handle x iterations at once - it proves that you can handle x iterations in 10 seconds with an average latency of y. (If y was huge, that might show we have a performance issue that needs addressing).
