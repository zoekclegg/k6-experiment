# k6 Performance Testing Playground

A personal sandbox for learning and experimenting with [k6](https://k6.io/) — a load testing tool for APIs and web apps.  
This repo follows along with the Udemy course: [k6 Load Testing & Performance Testing (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/k6-load-testing-performance-testing/)

## About

This project is for exploration and taking notes as I learn how to:

- Write and run load tests with k6
- Understand performance metrics
- Testing APIs and browser workflows
- Integrating with CI/CD pipelines

## Running a test

- On Mac - `k6 run ./first-script.js`
- On Windows - `k6 run .\first-script.js`
